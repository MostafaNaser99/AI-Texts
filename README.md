# AI-Texts
Training a model to discern if a text is written by a human or generated by an AI.

introduction
With the introduction of commercially available AI tools like ChatGPT, new challenges arise in the realm of digital communication. Now, the need to develop tools capable of discerning between human-authored text and AI-generated content is evermore crucial. From job applications to opinion surveys, ascertaining that the author is human is essential for the integrity and effectiveness of the operation. In this project, I utilize a simple machine learning model to classify text based on whether the author is human or an AI.

goals
•	develop a model capable of discerning between human text and AI generated content. 
•	Explore various text preprocessing methods for machine learning like vectorization and document embeddings.
•	 Optimize model to use the best hyperparameters.
•	Showcase model accuracy and precision.
